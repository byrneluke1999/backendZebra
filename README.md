This code will solve the zebra puzzle and output the solution and the steps to arrive at the solution to the command line.

# DIRECTIONS FOR USE #
Running the following command will solve the zebra puzzle.
```
python zebraToWeb.py zebra-puzzle-clues.txt output.JSON
```

Note:
- The .JSON files are outputted after running the zebraToWeb.py (The main file to solve the puzzle).
- I coded in python 3 for this project - this will run on python 2 interpreters, however executing may differ per version.
